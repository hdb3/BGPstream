functional modules in this library comsume and emit streams of objects
At a base level the streams correspond to network or filesystem endpoints.
Above this level messages are objects of various classes
modules cooperate using function/method calls to exchange message objects
modules are all 'stream processors' - some are sources or sinks - mostly network of filesystem based endpoints
- others both emit and consume objects.
a module acting as a consumer calls an iterator provided by a message source
sources and sinks are bound together by a framework module which instantiates stream processors and binds them
All processors are immpleneted as custom class objects derived from some basic framework classes
The bind operation calls a method on a consumer, passing in the source object
The consumer then calls an iterator provided by the source object.
For stream processors which have both source and sink capability the bind is done twice
